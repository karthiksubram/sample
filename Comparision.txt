# üìå **Apache Spark Deployment on OpenShift (OCP): Comparison of Approaches**

This document compares two widely used methods for deploying Apache Spark workloads on our shared OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) environment:

* **Helm Chart-based Deployment (Standalone Mode)**
* **Spark Operator (Kubernetes Native Mode)**

The goal of this comparison is to identify the optimal deployment model considering resource utilization, maintainability, scalability, and compatibility with our OCP setup.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **1. Helm Chart-based Spark Deployment (Standalone Mode)**

### **Overview**

Deploys Spark using Helm charts in **standalone cluster mode**:

* **Spark Master Pod** and **Worker Pods** run continuously.
* Jobs are submitted externally via `spark-submit` to the Spark Master.
* Executors are spawned inside existing Worker pods.

### **Key Characteristics**

| Feature                        | Details                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster Setup**              | Permanent Spark Master and Worker pods         |
| **Driver Pod Creation**        | Created via spark-submit                       |
| **Executor Pods**              | Executors run as JVM processes in Worker pods  |
| **Resource Scheduling**        | Managed by Spark Master (not Kubernetes-aware) |
| **Scalability**                | Limited, manual scaling                        |
| **Namespace Quota Management** | Challenging due to persistent pods             |
| **Maintenance & Upgrade**      | Requires manual Helm updates                   |
| **Monitoring & Logging**       | Requires custom setup                          |
| **Ideal Use-case**             | Static, long-running Spark clusters            |

### **Pros and Cons**

**Pros:**

* Simple initial setup via Helm.
* Suitable for static workloads or development environments.

**Cons:**

* Limited dynamic resource utilization.
* Poor integration with Kubernetes resource quotas.
* Difficult scaling, manual lifecycle management.
* Not optimized for multi-tenant namespace environments like ours.

## üöÄ **2. Spark Operator Deployment (Kubernetes Native Mode)**

### **Overview**

Deploys Spark workloads using **Spark Operator**:

* Spark Operator is deployed in namespace.
* Jobs are submitted as `SparkApplication` YAML manifests.
* Kubernetes directly manages Driver and Executor pods individually.

### **Key Characteristics**

| Feature                        | Details                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cluster Setup**              | No permanent Spark Master or Worker pods                     |
| **Driver Pod Creation**        | Created automatically by Spark Operator from CRDs            |
| **Executor Pods**              | Independent pods scheduled by Kubernetes                     |
| **Resource Scheduling**        | Kubernetes native (compatible with YuniKorn, etc.)           |
| **Scalability**                | Highly dynamic and elastic                                   |
| **Namespace Quota Management** | Excellent (pods fully Kubernetes-managed)                    |
| **Maintenance & Upgrade**      | Easy to upgrade and maintain via Operator updates            |
| **Monitoring & Logging**       | Native Prometheus integration, structured logging            |
| **Ideal Use-case**             | Dynamic jobs, batch processing, ML workloads, data pipelines |

### **Pros and Cons**

**Pros:**

* Excellent resource management and utilization.
* Direct Kubernetes integration (dynamic pod scheduling).
* Easier to automate via CI/CD pipelines.
* Ideal for multi-tenant, quota-based namespaces like ours.

**Cons:**

* Additional component (Operator) to maintain and upgrade.
* Slightly higher initial learning curve (CRDs).

## üìå **Summary & Recommendation**

Considering our shared OCP environment and namespace resource quotas:

* The **Helm-based standalone mode** is **not recommended** due to:

  * Poor scalability and resource management.
  * Manual lifecycle management overhead.
  * Inefficient resource utilization.

* The **Spark Operator model** is **highly recommended** for our organization because it:

  * Provides dynamic and efficient resource scheduling.
  * Integrates seamlessly with our Kubernetes-based OCP quotas.
  * Simplifies operational tasks and automates Spark workload deployments.

---

## üìù **Final Takeaway**

In the context of our OCP environment, the **Spark Operator** clearly emerges as the optimal solution. It maximizes resource efficiency, improves maintainability, and aligns perfectly with our CI/CD automation and namespace-based resource quotas.
