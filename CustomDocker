# Switch to root temporarily to change permissions
USER root

# Change permissions on the entrypoint script
# This makes it executable by "others" so your random UID can run it.

# Switch back to the non-root user that the original image typically uses
# (or choose a new non-root user if you want)
# You might need to inspect the original Dockerfile for the exact USER directive.
# Common users are 'jboss', 'default', 'nobody', or numerical UIDs.
# If the original image doesn't set a USER, it defaults to root.
# For UBI-based images, '1000' or 'jboss' is common.
# Let's assume 'jboss' for now if that's what the path suggests.
USER jboss # Or whatever the original USER was. If not specified, it's root.
